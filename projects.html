                <p> if you are a human in this world, I bet you heard of the environmental impacts
                    caused by meat consumption. But do you know where they happen? And how can we link
                    the beef that we had for dinner yesterday to the real impacts happening elsewehere
                    during production?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We traced some of these impacts by modeling animal and meat movements around the
                    United States. In the circular chart, you can see <i>virtual water</i> flows between States
                    and find where and how much water was used to produce beef that was consumed
                    during a year in a given state.
                </p>

            <div id="chart-title">
                <h2>meat and water</h2>

                <p> but can you be more specific? in this <i>bivariate map</i>,
                    you can see the correlation between production andconsumption at the county-level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note how the east coast generally has high values for consumption and low values
                    for production (bright red). Meanwhile, the counties colored as turquoise are
                    responsible for the majority of the production while consuming very little.
                    States in the west also have a higher number of counties that are both intense
                    producers and consumers (brown colors).
